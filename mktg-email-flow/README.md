# Beyond Vectors: How to Build a ChatGPT Super App

Join us for this upcoming webinar exploring how sales and marketing technology has evolved over time, and what’s now possible in today’s era of LLMs and Generative AI.

From the age-old "spray and pray" approach to sophisticated personalization strategies driven by AI and vector databases, our Head of Solution Engineering Sarung Tripathi will present an overview of how versatile general-purpose databases (with vector capabilities) can enhance prospect engagement and conversion rates. Sarung will also showcase how multi-model capabilities (covering JSON, NoSQL, and other data types) within LLMs can offer stronger contextual insights from various data stores (website and app data, etc) for even more personalized communications.

The spotlight of the webinar, however, will be Sarung’s demo of a modern general-purpose database application that can use vector embeddings, structured data and unstructured data to generate mass personalization at scale in milliseconds. In this insightful session, you'll grasp the real-world applications and advantages of this technology, setting a new standard for real-time, data-driven decision making.
