        "# Evaluating Generative AI Models with Llama 2 and Mistral 7B using SingleStore\n",
        "Welcome to this focused guide on evaluating two advanced Generative AI models, Llama 2 and Mistral 7B, using SingleStoreDB. This guide provides detailed steps, code examples, and best practices for a thorough comparison of these models.\n",
        "\n",
        "## Overview\n",
        "The aim is to evaluate Llama 2 and Mistral 7B, two distinct Large Language Models (LLMs), using SingleStoreDB. SingleStoreDB's high-performance, SQL-compliant database system enables efficient storage and retrieval, crucial for handling the extensive data involved in LLMs. This comparison focuses on the models' capabilities in real-time data processing, query response, and overall performance.\n",
        "\n",
        "## What You'll Learn\n",
        "- Setting up the environment with required packages and credentials.\n",
        "- Integrating Llama 2 and Mistral 7B with SingleStoreDB for data management.\n",
        "- Conducting comparative analysis of the models' performance.\n",
        "- Utilizing SingleStoreDB for storing and querying large datasets.\n",
        "- Assessing the models' efficiency in real-time query processing.\n",
        "\n",
        "## Prerequisites\n",
        "- Proficiency in Python.\n",
        "- Experience with SQL databases and SingleStoreDB.\n",
        "- An active SingleStoreDB instance.\n",
        "\n",
        "Get ready to explore the capabilities of Llama 2 and Mistral 7B in a head-to-head evaluation using SingleStoreDB.\n"
